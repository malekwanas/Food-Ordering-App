# Food Order App

This is a practice project based on the course "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" on Udemy. The Food Order App is a web application built with React, focusing on managing food orders and providing an intuitive user interface.

## Project Overview

The Food Order App allows users to browse through a menu of food items, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and place food orders. The app utilizes React functional components and hooks for managing state and implementing dynamic behavior.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src` folder: Contains the main source code files.
  - `components` folder: Contains reusable components used in the app.
  - `assets` folder: Contains static assets such as images or CSS files.
  - `App.js`: The main component that serves as the entry point for the app.
  - `App.css`: CSS styles specific to the App component.
  - `index.js`: Renders the App component and mounts it to the DOM.
- `public` folder: Contains the public assets and the `index.html` file.

## Key Features

The implemented features in the project include:

- Menu Display: The app displays a variety of food items with their images, descriptions, and prices.
- Cart Functionality: Users can add food items to a cart, adjust quantities, and view the total cost in real-time.
- Order Placement: Users can provide delivery details and confirm their food orders.
- User Feedback: Success and error messages are displayed to users for order confirmation and error handling.

## Installation and Setup

To run the Food Order App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Next Steps

I am planning to explore additional features such as implementing routing for different app pages, handling HTTP requests to a backend server for order submission, and incorporating Redux for global state management.
